In this problem set, we design four pwn CTF problem. Pwn is a leetspeak
  slang term derived from the verb own, meaning to appropriate or to
  conquer to gain ownership. - Wikipedia. There are special strings
  called 'flag' in the computer system that we provide via docker.
For each problem, there exists only one flag, and it looks like
  'flag{xxxx}'. The flag is dynamic, so each time you start a docker
  container, the flag may change. You only need to submit one. The four
  problems are stack overflow problems, so try to focus on the stack
  layout and solve the problem. Please do NOT try to reverse the 'flag()'
  function or your write-up will be treated as invalid.

Instruction:
  1. Download the tar ball associated with this assignment.
  2. Build the container via `docker build . -t ist543:problem_set_6`.
  3. Run the container via `docker run --privileged -it ist543:problem_set_6`.
  4. Read codes in pseudocode folder.
  5. Binaries lay in `/problem_set_6` of the container. Feed them with
    proper input and get a flag.
